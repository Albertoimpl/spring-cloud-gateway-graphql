=== BasicAuthGlobalFilter

The `BasicAuthGlobalFilter` creates a proxy `WebFilterChainProxy` to include a Spring Security chain with a basic configuration that includes BasicAuth by default.

```
SecurityWebFilterChain basicAuthFilter = ServerHttpSecurity
        .http()
        .authorizeExchange()
            .anyExchange().authenticated()
        .and()
        .build();
```

The `user` 's password is prompted in the logs by default.
```
Using generated security password: <your unsecure passowrd>
```

This is a basic security example that is not valid for a production environment.
Please, follow the https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.2.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle[documentation] to adjust the filter to your security requirements.
